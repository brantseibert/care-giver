# care-giver

The Care Giver function provides a handle on the geo location of each care giver in a metro area and provides the care giver a recommendation of which patient to visit at home next.

This function is to be utilised in conjunction with the patient profiles.  In addition to geo locating each patient, we run classification and regression algorithms to scoe the criticality of each patient.

By combining these functions we power an mobile app which provides a single-glance view with map and directions, as well as, drill down to the details for each patient.
